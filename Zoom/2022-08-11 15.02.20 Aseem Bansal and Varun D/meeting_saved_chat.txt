	If a message comes from an unrecognised address, create a new Jira user with the user name and email address set to the 'From' address of the message.
	The password for the new user is randomly generated, and an email is sent to the new user informing them about their new account in Jira.
15:32:47 From Varun D to Everyone:
	There are typically 2 causes:
	
	O365 configuration to allow IMAP over OAuth2.0 is incomplete as Client Access Rules is missing "IMAP4" rule. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/client-access-rules/client-access-rules
	When following the steps to configure your Jira incoming mail server to use OAuth 2.0, the request to "Authorize" was not completed by the mailbox owner or delegated user.
